# wordle-api

An API built for my Definitely not Wordle web game. 

[Deployed on Render](https://wordle-api-geearen.onrender.com/home)

# HTTP Request
- get /api/word - return the word of the day in JSON
- get /api/words - return a JSON word bank
- post /api/word - this compares the word of the day and user input from the game and returns color values for each letter
